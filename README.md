# WindowsVersions

originally planned on making a api to download ios files but thats kind of illegal so isntead a api to fetch all of the windows versions that existed

- [x] Main Windows Versions
- [ ] Other Editions of the Main Windows Versions (Home, Pro, Entreprise, Education etc)
- [ ] Other goofy windows versions like windows server and stuff and windows tablets/phones
- [ ] Maybe support for their codenames too :/
